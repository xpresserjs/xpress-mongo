# Xpress Mongo
A light mongodb model/helper library for nodejs, provides modeling for your documents while keeping you very close to mongodb native syntax which is always recommended.

**xpress-mongo** is not bond to the xpresser framework but was built by same developers, so we decided to host its documentation on the xpresser website.
