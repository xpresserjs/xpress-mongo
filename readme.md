A light mongodb model/helper library for nodejs, provides modeling for your documents while keeping you very close to
mongodb native syntax which is always recommended.

Documentation: [https://xpresserjs.com/xpress-mongo](https://xpresserjs.com/xpress-mongo/)

Note: **xpress-mongo** is not bond to the xpresser framework but was built by same developers, so we decided to host its
documentation on the xpresser website.
