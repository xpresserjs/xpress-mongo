# Xpress Mongo

This version [<=1.5.3](https://npmjs.com/package/xpress-mongo/old) has reached its end of life, and will only get updated when there is a bug.
The new recommended version is [>=2.2.0](https://npmjs.com/package/xpress-mongo). Which uses mongodb's new native version [=>4.0](https://npmjs.com/package/mongodb) that was shipped with lots of **good breaking changes.**

## Installation
```sh
npm i xpress-mongo@old
# OR
yarn add xpress-mongo@old
```

## About
A light mongodb model/helper library for nodejs, provides modeling for your documents while keeping you very close to
mongodb native syntax which is always recommended.

**xpress-mongo** is not bond to the xpresser framework but was built by same developers, so we decided to host its
documentation on the xpresser website.
