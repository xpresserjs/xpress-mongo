# Xpress Mongo
A light mongodb model/helper library for nodejs, provides modeling for your documents and also keeps you very close to native mongodb syntax which is always recommended.

**xpress-mongo** is not bond to the xpresser framework but was built by same developers, so we decided to host its docs on the xpresser website.
